        The <strong>Nutcracker</strong> "is loosely based on the E.T.A. Hoffmann
        fantasy story The Nutcracker and the Mouse King, about a girl who
        befriends a nutcracker that comes to life on Christmas Eve and wages a
        battle against the evil Mouse King."
      </p>
      <p>
        "According to German folklore, nutcrackers we given as keepsakes to
        bring luck to the family and protect the home. It is said that they
        represent strength and power and watches over the family keeping evil
        spirits and danger away."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Do The Nutcracker and Clara fall in love? THIS IS NOT A LOVE STORY
        Unlike almost every other ballet from the 19th century, ‚ÄúThe Nutcracker‚Äù
        isn't about falling in love. So if you see the heroine Clara dancing a
        romantic pas de deux with the Nutcracker prince, you're watching an
        alternative version; I call this anti-‚ÄúNutcracker‚Äù behavior."

        Run Time: 2 hours and 3 minutes, including a 25-minute intermission.

        She plays Clara. With Liliana's amzing dance, sining, and acting skills
        she give the play a whole other perspective. The character Clara is "the
        young girl who is the heroine of the story. She receives the Nutcracker
        doll at her parent's annual holiday party, which begins the adventure.
        She wears banana curls and ribbons in her hair, a pretty white dress and
        petticoats. Fritz is Clara's mischievous younger brother."

        Their mouths and gills form a powerful sucking system that sucks their
        prey in from a distance. They also use their mouths to dig into sand to
        form their shelters under big rocks, jetting it out through their gills.
        Their gill muscles are so powerful, it is nearly impossible to pull them
        out of a cave if they feel attacked and extend those muscles to lock
        themselves in.
